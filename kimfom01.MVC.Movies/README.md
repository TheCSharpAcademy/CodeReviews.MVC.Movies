# Movies

This is a web-based movie management application that allows users to browse and search movies by title or genre. The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and uses an external API to fetch movie data, which is then populated into a database. The user can view movies on the homepage, but editing or deletion of movies is restricted to the admin. An admin page is provided to manage the database and populate it with a fresh set of movies.

### Given Requirements
